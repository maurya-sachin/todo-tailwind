# To-Do List Application with Tailwind CSS

This is a simple and interactive To-Do List application built using **Tailwind CSS** and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed with a strikethrough effect, and delete them. The app also supports **dark mode** which is persistent across browser sessions.

## Features:

- ‚ú® **Add New Tasks**: Create tasks to be completed.
- ‚úÖ **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Toggle strikethrough effect when tasks are completed.
- üóëÔ∏è **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- üåô **Dark Mode Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes, with the theme persisted across sessions.

## Technologies Used:

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **JavaScript**: Logic to handle tasks and dark mode functionality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling framework to make the app responsive and beautiful.
- **Parcel**: Bundler to bundle and serve the application.

## Installation Instructions:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash

## How to Generate Tailwind CSS:

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. To compile and watch Tailwind CSS, use the following command:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/style.css --watch
```

This command watches for changes in the `input.css` file, processes them through Tailwind, and outputs the result to `style.css` in the `src` folder.

---

## Dark Mode:

This project supports dark mode, which can be toggled using the theme button. The theme is saved to **localStorage**, meaning your preference is remembered the next time you visit the app.

#### Dark Mode Toggle:

- üåô **Dark Mode:** The button icon will show a moon symbol.
- ‚òÄÔ∏è **Light Mode:** The button icon will change to a sun symbol when dark mode is active.
